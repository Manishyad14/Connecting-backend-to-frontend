# Project Title: Fullstack Development: Connecting Frontend and Backend

## Overview

This project demonstrates best practices for connecting a frontend application to a backend server. It covers setting up the backend with Express, connecting the frontend and backend using Fullstack Proxy and CORS, and configuring proxies to standardize and simplify API requests. The project also addresses handling cross-origin requests and whitelisting URLs to avoid errors.

## Understanding Best Practices

In this section, you will learn about the best practices for backend and frontend development, including setting up your development environment, structuring your project, and ensuring efficient communication between the frontend and backend.

## Setting Up the Backend

Learn how to set up the backend of your project, starting with installing necessary packages and initializing your server.

## Creating a Server with Express

This section covers the creation of a server using Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js. You will set up routes and middleware to handle incoming requests.

## Connecting Backend with Frontend

### Using Fullstack Proxy and CORS

Understand how to connect your backend and frontend applications using Fullstack Proxy and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). This section includes:

- Setting up the backend and frontend connection
- Requesting a GET from Jio
- Cross-origin requests and whitelisting URLs to avoid errors
- Configuring whitelisting to allow only specified IPs or domains

### Standardization of Backend API

Standardize your backend API by configuring your server to automatically append `/api` to requests. Learn how proxies are used to standardize and simplify URL requests.

## Handling Cross-Origin Requests

This section explains cross-origin requests and how to whitelist URLs to avoid errors. Learn how to configure whitelisting to allow only specified IPs or domains.

## Configuring Proxies

Discover how to use proxies to standardize and simplify URL requests. Proxies help the server understand the origin of requests and handle errors related to CORS.

## Issues with Propagating Frontend Changes

Identify common issues with propagating frontend changes to the backend and how to resolve them effectively. This section includes practical tips for maintaining synchronization between frontend and backend during development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Express
- Understanding of frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Vue)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies for the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
4. Install dependencies for the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the frontend application.
- The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
